     # bank client data:
    1 - age (numeric)
    2 - job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')
    3 - marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
    4 - education (categorical: 'basic.4y','basic.6y','basic.9y','high.school','illiterate','professional.course','university.degree','unknown')
    5 - default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
    6 - housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
    7 - loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')
    # related with the last contact of the current campaign:
    8 - contact: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')
    9 - month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')
    10 - day_of_week: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
    11 - duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.
    # other attributes:
    12 - campaign: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)
    13 - pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
    14 - previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)
    15 - poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')
    # social and economic context attributes
    16 - emp.var.rate: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)
    17 - cons.price.idx: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)
    18 - cons.conf.idx: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)
    19 - euribor3m: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)
    20 - nr.employed: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)
    21 - y - has the client subscribed a term deposit? (binary: 'yes','no')

## Exploring the Data:<a name="viz"></a>

Here I will use pandas and seaborn visualization skills to determine if Fandango's ratings in 2015 had a bias towards rating movies better to sell more tickets.

**Matplotlib:**<a name="matplotlib"></a>
--------
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.You can draw up all sorts of charts(such as Bar Graph, Pie Chart, Box Plot, Histogram. Subplots ,Scatter Plot and many more) and visualization using matplotlib.

Environment Setup==
If you have Python and Anaconda installed on your computer, you can use any of the methods below to install matplotlib:

     pip: pip install matplotlib

     anaconda: conda install matplotlib
     
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

for more information you can refer to [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) official site

**Seaborn:**<a name="seaborn"></a>
------
Seaborn is built on top of Python’s core visualization library Matplotlib. Seaborn comes with some very important features that make it easy to use. Some of these features are:

**Visualizing univariate and bivariate data.**

**Fitting and visualizing linear regression models.**

**Plotting statistical time series data.**

**Seaborn works well with NumPy and Pandas data structures**

**Built-in themes for styling Matplotlib graphics**

**The knowledge of Matplotlib is recommended to tweak Seaborn’s default plots.**

Environment Setup==
If you have Python and Anaconda installed on your computer, you can use any of the methods below to install seaborn:

    pip: "pip install seaborn"*

    anaconda: " conda install seaborn"*
    import seaborn as sns
    
for more information you can refer to [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) official site.

## using KMeans for clustering:<a name="conclusion"></a>

K-Means Clustering, also known as Lloyd’s Algorithm, is an iterative, data-partitioning, Unsupervised Learning Algorithm used to assign n observations to exactly one of K clusters defined by their centroids, where K is chosen before the algorithm starts.

Clustering

The most basic definition of clustering is the technique of grouping data points together. It is an assumption that data points of the same group posses similar properties or features, whereas data points from different groups will have high dissimilarity. Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning Method and is commonly used for statistical data analysis in many fields. With clustering, we only try to investigate the structure of the data by grouping them.

steps for Kmeans

•Step 1: Choose the number of clusters k. ...

•Step 2: Select k random points from the data as centroids. ...

•Step 3: Assign all the points to the closest cluster centroid. ...

•Step 4: Recompute the centroids of newly formed clusters. ...

•Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4.

Stopping Criteria for K-Means Clustering

There are essentially three stopping criteria that can be adopted to stop the K-means algorithm:

•Centroids of newly formed clusters do not change

•Points remain in the same cluster

•Maximum number of iterations are reached

We can stop the algorithm if the centroids of newly formed clusters are not changing. Even after multiple iterations, if we are getting the same centroids for all the clusters, we can say that the algorithm is not learning any new pattern and it is a sign to stop the training.

Another clear sign that we should stop the training process if the points remain in the same cluster even after training the algorithm for multiple iterations.

Finally, we can stop the training if the maximum number of iterations is reached. Suppose if we have set the number of iterations as 100. The process will repeat for 100 iterations before stopping.
